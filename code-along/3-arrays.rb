# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
today_list = ["grocery", "coding", "timepass", "movie"]
# puts today_list

p_today_list = ["sleep", "exam", "fight"]
# puts p_today_list

together_list = today_list + p_today_list
# puts together_list
puts together_list [3]

# Accessing the array

# Add to the array

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
